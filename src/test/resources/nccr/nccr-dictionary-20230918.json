Estimates are calculated by specifying the cause of death. Individuals who die of causes other than the specified cause are considered to be censored. This requires a cause of death variable that accurately captures all causes related to the specific cause. Vital records offices use algorithms to process causes of death from death certificates in order to identify a single, disease-specific, underlying cause of death. In some cases, attribution of a single cause of death may be difficult and misattribution may occur. For example a death may be attributed to the site of metastasis instead of the primary site.  \n  \nTo capture deaths related to the specific cancer but not coded as such, the SEER cause-specific death classification variables are defined by taking into account causes of deaths in conjunction with tumor sequence (i.e., only one tumor or the first of subsequent tumors), site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities (e.g., AIDS and/or site-related diseases).  \n  \nThe 'SEER cause-specific death classification' variable is used to obtain cancer-specific survival probability for a given cohort of cancer patients.

This data item differs from Sequence Number-Hospital \\[560\\], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one _in situ_ or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, but 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry’s reference date. \r\n\r\n**Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined** \r\n\r\nThe Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining the reportable neoplasms is described in Chapter III, Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability. It is assumed that this shared standard is the “minimum” definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable.\r\n\r\nNumeric codes in the 00-59 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of _in situ_ or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in Chapter III) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an _in situ_ or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central. The two notational systems are independent but central registries should take Sequence Number-Hospital \\[560\\] into account when coding Sequence Number Central.",
